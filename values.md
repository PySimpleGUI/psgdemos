## Create a Windows 1-Click Shortcut

psgdemos is your first stop when implementing any new feature for your
application. To keep psgdemos at your fingertips, on Windows, you can
create a shortcut that keeps psgdemos as close as a single click. Use
the [`psgshortcut` application](https://pypi.org/project/psgshortcut/)
app to make such shortcuts. You can then add the shortcut to your
desktop or taskbar and launch psgdemos with a single click!

To do this, follow these steps:

1. `pip install psgshortcut`
1. Open a command window (We promise, it's the last time you'll need the command line for psgdemos)
2. Type `where psgdemos`
3. Copy the resulting line into psgshortcut first input
4. Run psgdemos by typing `psgdemos` in your command window
5. Right click and choose "File Location"
6. Copy the file location results, but change the extension from .py to .ico and paste into the Icon file input of the shortcut maker
7. Click "Create Shortcut"

These steps create a shortcut in the same folder as the target file. You can now move this shortcut file to any place you want (like to your desktop). Double-click the shortcut and your program will launch.
