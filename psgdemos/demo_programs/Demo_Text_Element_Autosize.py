    Demo of autosize of Text Element

    Beginning in version 4.46.0 the Text element will fully autosize if:
        * auto_size_text is True (default)
        * No size is supplied or (None, None) is supplied

    "Fully autosize" means that both the element and the window will grow/shrink 
        as the contents of the Text element changes.

    Prior versions autosized in 1 direction, either horizontally or vertically
        * Set size = (None, int) to autosize horizontally
        * Set size = (int, None) to autosize vertically

    By default autosize is enabled, but setting a size parameter will disable unless None is specified
        in one of the directions.
