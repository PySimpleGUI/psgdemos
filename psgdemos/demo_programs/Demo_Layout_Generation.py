    PySimpleGUI is designed & authored in Python to take full advantage the awesome Python constructs & capabilities.
    Layouts are represented as lists to PySimpleGUI. Lists are fundamental in Python and have a number of powerful
    capabilities that PySimpleGUI exploits.
       
    Many times PySimpleGUI programs can benefit from using CODE to GENERATE your layouts.  This Demo illustrates
    a number of ways of "building" a layout. Some work on 3.5 and up.  Some are basic and show concatenation of rows
    to build up a layout.  Some utilize generators.
    
    These 8 "Constructs" or Design Patterns demonstrate numerous ways of "generating" or building your layouts
    0 - A simple list comprehension to build a row of buttons
    1 - A simple list comprehension to build a column of buttons
    2 - Concatenation of rows within a layout
    3 - Concatenation of 2 complete layouts [[ ]] + [[ ]] = [[ ]]
    4 - Concatenation of elements to form a single row [ [] + [] + [] ] = [[ ]]
    5 - Questionnaire - Using a double list comprehension to build both rows and columns in a single line of code
    6 - Questionnaire - Unwinding the comprehensions into 2 for loops instead
    7 - Using the * operator to unpack generated items onto a single row 
    8 - Multiple Choice Test - a practical use showing list comprehension and concatenated layout

    Comprehensions are super-powers of Python.  In this example we're using a comprehension to create 4 buttons that

    However, here, we want to not just have a row of buttons, we want have an OK button at the bottom.
    To do this, you "add" the rest of the GUI layout onto the end of the generated part.
    
    Note - you can't end the layout line after the +. If you wanted to put the OK button on the next line, you need
    to add a \ at the end of the first line.
    See next Construct on how to not use a \ that also results in a VISUALLY similar to a norma layout

    Also shown is the OLD tried and true way, using layout.append.  You will see the append technique in many of the
    Demo programs and probably elsewhere.  Hoping to remove these and instead use this more explicit method of +=.
    
    Using the + operator, as you've already seen, can be used in the middle of the layout.  A call to append you cannot
    use this way because it modifies the layout list directly.

    Construct #5 - Simple "concatenation" of layouts
    Layouts are lists of lists.  Some of the examples and demo programs use a .append method to add rows to layouts.
    These will soono be replaced with this new technique.  It's so simple that I don't know why it took so long to
    find it.
    This layout uses list comprehensions heavily, and even uses 2 of them. So, if you find them confusing, skip down
    to the next Construct and you'll see the same layout built except for loops are used rather than comprehensions
    
    The next 3 examples all use this same window that is layed out like this:
        Each row is:
    Text1, Text2, Radio1, Radio2, Radio3, Radio4, Radio5
    Text1, Text2, Radio1, Radio2, Radio3, Radio4, Radio5
    ...
    
    It shows, in particular, this handy bit of layout building, a += to add on additional rows.
    layout =  [[stuff on row 1], [stuff on row 2]]
    layout += [[stuff on row 3]]

        List comprehension inside the layout
        Addition of rows to layouts
        All in a single variable assignment
        
    NOTE - this particular code, using the * operator, will not work on Python 2 and think it was added in Python 3.5
    
    This code shows a bunch of questions with Radio Button choices
    
    There is a double-loop comprehension used.  One that loops through the questions (rows) and the other loops through
    the Radio Button choices.
    Thus each row is:
    Text1, Text2, Radio1, Radio2, Radio3, Radio4, Radio5
    Text1, Text2, Radio1, Radio2, Radio3, Radio4, Radio5

    from the list... one after another, as if they are separated with comma.  It's a way of "unpacking" from within
    a statement.
