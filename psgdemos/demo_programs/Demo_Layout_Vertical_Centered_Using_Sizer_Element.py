    Sizer Element

    Using a Sizer Element to set the size of a window without setting the size on the Window.

    If you use the size parameter for a window, you may end up cutting off a portion of your Window
        if the contents of layout are greater in size than the hard coded size you used.

    You can use a Sizer element to "pad" a layout into something bigger.

    This Element is actually implemented using a Column inside of PySimpleGUI so it's not an
    element in reality, but more along the lines of a User Defined Element

    This demo shows how you can make a 500x500 pixel window without hardcoding the size and while
        also centering the contents of your layout.
