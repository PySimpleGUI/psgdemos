"""
    Demonstration of how to use a GRAPH ELEMENT to draw a webcam stream using OpenCV and PySimpleGUI.
    Additionally, the thing this demo is really showcasing, is the ability to draw over the top of this
    webcam stream, as it's being displayed.  To "Draw" simply move your mouse over the image, left click and hold, and
    then drag your mouse.  You'll see a series of red circles on top of your image.
    CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS WITH PySimpleGUI, NOT any of the other ports at this time.
    
    Note also that this demo is using ppm as the image format.  This worked fine on all PySimpleGUI ports except 
    the web port.  If you have trouble with the imencode statement, change "ppm" to "png"
