    Custom Titlebar - Async Version

    Demo showing how to remove the titlebar and replace with your own
    Unlike previous demos that lacked a titlebar, this one provides a way for you
    to "minimize" your window that does not have a titlebar.  This is done by faking
    the window using a hidden window that is minimized.

    While this demo uses the button colors for the titlebar color, you can use anything you want.
    If possible it could be good to use combinations that are known to match like the input element colors
    or the button colors.

    This version of the demo allows for async execution of your code.  In another demo of this
    custom titlebar idea, the user window would stop when the window is minimized.  This is OK
    for most applications, but if you're running a window with a timeout value (an async window)
    then stopping execution when the window is minimized is not good.

    The way to achieve both async window and the custom titlebar is to use the "read_all_windows"
    function call.  Using this function with a timeout has the same effect as running your
    window.read with a timeout.

    Additionally, if you right click and choose "close" on the minimized window on your
    taskbar, now the program will exist rather than restoring the window like the other demo does.
