    Demo one_line_progress_meter

    Add 1 line of code, get a very nice graphical progress meter window

    As a software engineer, it's frustrating to know that there is a better way that
    are not being shown. Adding a progress meter to your loop does not require 2 lines
    of code. It can be done with 1.

    So many of the popular progress meter packages require multiple changes to your code.
    There are 2 varieties:
        * Add 2 lines of code
            1. Add - A setup outside your loop
            2. Add - A call to a meter update function inside inside your loop
        * Modify 1, add 1
            1. Modify - Your existing for statement to use an iterator made by the meter API
            2. Add - A call to the meter update function inside your loop

    The PySimpleGUI "One Line Progress Meter" requires you to:
        * Add - A call to the meter update funciton inside your loop
