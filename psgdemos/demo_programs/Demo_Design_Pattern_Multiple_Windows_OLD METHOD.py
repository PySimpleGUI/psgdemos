    Demo - Running 2 windows with both being active at the same time
    Three important things to note about this design patter:
        1. The layout for window 2 is inside of the while loop, just before the call to window2=sg.Window
        2. The read calls have timeout values of 100 and 0.  You can change the 100 to whatever interval you wish
            but must keep the second window's timeout at 0
        3. There is a safeguard to stop from launching multiple copies of window2.  Only 1 window2 is visible at a time
