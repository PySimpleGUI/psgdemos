    Demo - 2 simultaneous windows using read_all_window

    Both windows are immediately visible.  Each window updates the other.
    
    There's an added capability to "re-open" window 2 should it be closed.  This is done by simply calling the make_win2 function
    again when the button is pressed in window 1.
    
    The program exits when both windows have been closed
