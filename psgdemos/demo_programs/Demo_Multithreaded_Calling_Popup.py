    Threaded Demo - Uses Window.write_event_value to communicate from thread to GUI
    
    A demo specifically to show how to use write_event_value to
        "show a popup from a thread"
        
    You cannot make any direct calls into PySimpleGUI from a thread
    except for Window.write_event_value()
    Cuation - This method still has a risk of tkinter crashing
