    Demo - Layout "Reuse" (but NOT reusing the layout)
    As cautioned in the PySimpleGUI documentation, layouts cannot be "reused".
    
    That said, there is a very simple design pattern that you'll find in many many
    Demo Programs.  Any program that is capable of changing the theme uses this
    same kind of pattern.
    
    Goal - write the layout code once and then use it multiple times
        The layout is reused 
    
    Solution - create the layout and window in a function and return it
