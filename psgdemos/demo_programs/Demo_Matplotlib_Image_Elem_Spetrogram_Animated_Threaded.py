    Demo_Matplotlib_Image_Elem_Spetrogram_Animated_Threaded Demo

    Demo to show
        * How to use an Image element to show a Matplotlib figure
        * How to draw a Spectrogram
        * How to animate the drawing by simply erasing and drawing the entire figure
        * How to communicate between a thread and the GUI

    The point here is to keep things simple to enable you to get started.

    NOTE:
        This threaded technique with matplotlib hasn't been thoroughly tested.
        There may be resource leaks for example.  Have run for several hundred seconds
        without problems so it's perhaps safe as written.

    The example static graph can be found in the matplotlib gallery:
    https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/specgram_demo.html
