"""
    Threading Demo - "Call popup from a thread"

    Can be extended to call any PySimpleGUI function by passing the function through the queue


    Safest approach to threading is to use a Queue object to communicate
    between threads and maintrhead.

    The thread calls popup, a LOCAL function that should be called with the same
    parameters that would be used to call opiup when called directly

    The parameters passed to the local popup are passed through a queue to the main thread.
    When a messages is received from the queue, sg.popup is called using the parms passed
    through the queue
