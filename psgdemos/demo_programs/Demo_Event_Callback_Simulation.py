'''
    Event Callback Simulation
    
    This design pattern simulates callbacks for events.  
    This is NOT the "normal" way things work in PySimpleGUI and is an architecture that is actively discouraged
    Unlike tkinter, Qt, etc, PySimpleGUI does not utilize callback
    functions as a mechanism for communicating when button presses or other events happen.
    BUT, should you want to quickly convert some existing code that does use callback functions, then this
    is one way to do a "quick and dirty" port to PySimpleGUI.
