    Demo - User Settings

    Use the "user_settings" API calls to make a "settings window"

    This demo is very basic. The user_settings functions are used directly without a lookup table
    or some other mechanism to map between PySimpleGUI keys and user settings keys. 
    
    Two windows are shown.  One is a super-simple "save previously entered filename"
    The other is a larger "settings window" where multiple settings are saved/loaded

    Creates a new window.  The default values for some elements are pulled directly from the
    "User Settings" without the use of temp variables.

    Some get_entry calls don't have a default value, such as theme, because there was an initial call
    that would have set the default value if the setting wasn't present.  Could still put the default
    value if you wanted but it would be 2 places to change if you wanted a different default value.

    Use of a lookup table to map between element keys and user settings could be aded. This demo
    is intentionally done without one to show how to use the settings APIs in the most basic,
    straightforward way.

    If your application allows changing the theme, then a make_window function is good to have
    so that you can close and re-create a window easily.
