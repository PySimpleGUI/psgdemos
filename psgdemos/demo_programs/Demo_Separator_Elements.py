    Demo - Separator Elements

    Shows usage of both Horizontal and Vertical Separator Elements
    Vertical Separators are placed BETWEEN 2 elements ON the same row.  These work well when one
        of the elements is a Column or the element spans several rows

    Horizontal separators are placed BETWEEN 2 rows.  They will occupy the entire span of the row they
        are located on. If that row is constrained within a container, then it will spand the widget of
        the container.
