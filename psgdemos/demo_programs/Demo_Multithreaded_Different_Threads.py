"""
    DESIGN PATTERN - Multithreaded GUI
    One method for running multiple threads in a PySimpleGUI environment.
    The PySimpleGUI code, and thus the underlying GUI framework, runs as the primary, main thread
    Other parts of the software are implemented as threads
    
    While users never know the implementation details within PySimpleGUI, the mechanism is that a queue.Queue
    is used to communicate data between a thread and a PySimpleGUI window.
    The PySimpleGUI code is structured just like a typical PySimpleGUI program.  A layout defined,
        a Window is created, and an event loop is executed.
