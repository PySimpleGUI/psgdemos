"""
    Threaded Demo - Uses Window.write_event_value communications
    
    Requires PySimpleGUI.py version 4.25.0 and later
    
    This is a really important demo  to understand if you're going to be using multithreading in PySimpleGUI.
    
    Older mechanisms for multi-threading in PySimpleGUI relied on polling of a queue. The management of a communications
    queue is now performed internally to PySimpleGUI.

    The importance of using the new window.write_event_value call cannot be emphasized enough.  It will hav a HUGE impact, in
    a positive way, on your code to move to this mechanism as your code will simply "pend" waiting for an event rather than polling.
