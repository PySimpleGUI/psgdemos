    tkinter and Qt do not "activate" buttons by pressing the ENTER key with the button highlighted / in focus
    This demo will enable the application to click on a button if the button has focus (is highlighted) and the
    user presses the ENTER key.
    NOTE that the SPACE BAR works correctly out of the box with both tkinter and Qt.  If a button has focus and 
    you press the space bar, then tkinter and Qt will both consider that a button click.  But not so with the ENTER
    key.
    
    The solution is for your program to read the keyboard presses and act upon those directly.  It's trivial logic
    in the end:
    1. Get a key press
    2. See if the key is the ENTER key
    3. Find the Element that currently has focus
    4. Click the Button if the Element with focus is a button
