    Demo Status Bar
    
    This demo shows you how to create your statusbar in a way that will keep it at the bottom of
    a resizeable window.  The key is the correct setting of the Expand settings for both the 
    StatusBar (done for you) and for a line above it that will keep it pushed to the bottom of the window.
    It's possible to also "simulate" a statusbar (i.e. use a text element or something else) by also
    configuring that element with the correct expand setting (X direction = True, expand row=True)
