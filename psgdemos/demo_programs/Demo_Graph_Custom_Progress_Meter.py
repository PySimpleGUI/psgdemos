    Demo Graph Custom Progress Meter

    The "Graph Element" is a "Gateway Element"
    Looking to create your own custom elements?  Then the Graph Element is an excellent
    place to start.

    This short demo implements a Circular Progress Meter

    The event loop has a little trick some may like....
        Rather than adding a sleep instead use window.read with a timeout
        This has a dual purpose. You get the delay you're after AND your GUI is refreshed
