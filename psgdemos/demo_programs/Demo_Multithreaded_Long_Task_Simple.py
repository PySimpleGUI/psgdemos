"""
    DESIGN PATTERN - Multithreaded Long Tasks GUI using shared global variables

    Presents one method for running long-running operations in a PySimpleGUI environment.
    The PySimpleGUI code, and thus the underlying GUI framework, runs as the primary, main thread
    The "long work" is contained in the thread that is being started. Communicating is done (carefully) using global variables

    There are 2 ways "progress" is being reported to the user. 
    You can simulate the 2 different scenarios that happen with worker threads.
    1.  If a the amount of time is known ahead of time or the work can be broken down into countable units, then a progress bar is used.  
    2.  If a task is one long chunk of time that cannot be broken down into smaller units, then an animated GIF is shown that spins as
    long as the task is running.
