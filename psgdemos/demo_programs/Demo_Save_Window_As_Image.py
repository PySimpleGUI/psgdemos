    Demo - Saving the contents of a window as an image file
    
    This demo will teach you how to save any portion of your window to an image file.
    You can save in JPG, GIF, or PNG format.
    
    In this example the entire window's layout is placed into a single Column Element.  This allows
    us to save an image of the Column which saves the entire window layout
    
    Portions of windows can be saved, such as a Graph Element, by specifying the Graph Element instead of the Column
