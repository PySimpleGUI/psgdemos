"""
    Allows you to "browse" through the theme settings.  Click on one and you'll see a 
    Popup window using the color scheme you chose.  It's a simply little program that demonstrates
    how snappy a GUI can feel if you enable an element's events rather than waiting on a button click.
    In this program, as soon as a listbox entry is clicked, the read returns.
